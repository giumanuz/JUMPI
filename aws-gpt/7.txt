To replace an old prison-like home for abnormal children located in the center of Milan (see the two small pictures on this page), a new building has been erected on the outskirts of town. It is based on principles entirely different from those that dictated the forms of the old building. There are no fences or barriers, dormitories are designed to hold no more than 12 beds, and outdoor living is encouraged. The design, only part of which has already been built, includes an entrance and gatekeeper's building (1-5), living quarters with gymnasiums, theaters, and workshops (6-9), schoolrooms (10-11), instructors' living quarters (13), and the church (14). Even the brutal architectural lines are designed in keeping with psycho-pedagogical criteria.
